# Face-Net
As a part of the project i have done the following:
>DEEP LEARNING COURSES ON COURSERA

>Read RESNET, INCEPTIONNET, MOBILENETv2 papers to understand how CNN's work

>Read FACENET, DEEPFACE papers to understand how face learning algorithms work

The coursera courses for learning about Deep learning works using neural networks and use of cnns for facial recognition and how it becomes complex on going deeper into the networks from edge detection to complex figures

Read Resnet to understand how adding residual to next layer helps the cnns to get better accuracy and faster optimisation without much increase in computation and no increase in weights required to be trained

Read Inception net to see how using many convulations on the layer help extract many features at the same time making the accuracy higher and better with a managable increase in computation

Read Mobilenet to see how the computation can be reduced so much such that even mobilephones can do these computation at a faster rate with a small sacrifice of accuracy

Read Deepface to see how the triangulation and making the image into a 3d projection and using siamese networks help recognize people better

Read Facenet to see how triplet loss of selecting 2 images of a specific person and one of some one looking same but not the same person and use them to find weights using cnns such that only the correct person can be recognised

Implemented Facenet on LFW(Labeled Faces in the wild) dataset to check its accuracy, cropped the images using opencv so that only faces are present in the images
